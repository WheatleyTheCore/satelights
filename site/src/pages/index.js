                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>
                        SatelLights is a data physicalization that aims to bring some of nature back into everyday life in the city. Generally, you can't see the stars in Worcester due to light pollution. This installation displays what would be seen in the night sky onto a ceiling, aiming to provide at least a little bit of the same experience and inspiration.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Intended Audience</h2>

                    WPI students (espeically those living in my apartment) tend to be very stressed. Going out in nature and being reminded of the larger world often helps with this, but it's something one must actively choose to do (and is also difficult in a city). This installation aims to be a reminder to appreciate it even so. 

                    <Image
                        src={"/working_lights.png"}
                        width={"600"}
                        height={"800"}
                    />

                    <p>
                        As seen above, it consists of rows of RGB LED strings,
                        that can be individually controlled. As such, the night
                        sky can be projected and dynaimcally updated based on
                        user input. (I promise it's much more pretty in person.)
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This input can be given though two applications,
                        SatelSITE and sAPPellite, seen below. The former is a website
                        through which you can control the display, and the
                        second is a mobile application that offers the same
                        functionality. Both enable the user to send "what
                        direction am I looking" data to the system, where it can
                        update accordingly.
                    </p>

                        height="400"
                        controls="controls"
                    />

                    <video
                        src={"app.mp4"}
                        width="800"
                        height="800"
                        controls="controls"
                    />

                    <p>
                        Both communicate over the network, with the idea being
                        that both people can connect from their mobile device
                        (provided they're on the same wifi network as the
                        system) and control it.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The System they are controlling is 3D model of most
                        visible stars, the planets of the solar system, and a
                        number of orbiting satellites. This data is updated in
                        real time, so the display shows a model of the sky as it
                        would be visible from your position.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Below is a video showing the systeml with the camera
                        moved so you can see the earth and viewer. The viewer is
                        shown as an orage rectangle, the planets are purple
                        blobs, and the stars are white cubes. For visibility
                        once going through the image-to-LED-maxtrix algorithm
                        the stars and planets are only a fourth of their actual
                        distance, but the system is originally designed to have
                        accurate distances between all objects.

                        controls="controls"
                    />

                    <p>
                        This image then has a <i>lot</i> of math done to it to
                        get it into a format the lights controller can use.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This data then gets sent over the network to the lights
                        controller, which outputs it to the display. Below is
                        the LED matrix as I pan and tilt the view around, to
                        look at stars in different directions. The color coding
                        is the same as for the space model.
                    </p>

                        height="800"
                        controls="controls"
                    />

                    <p>
                        The framerate is unfortunately a little low, but it's been faster when the Raspberry Pi it's running on isn't also listening to the
                        network communications. This is still something I am
                        working on.
                    </p>
